# Event Based Camera Project: Simultaneous Mosaicing and Tracking

Authors: Céline Nauer, Joël Bachmann, Nik Dennler

We attempt to implement the methods proposed by Kim et. al (2014) to simultaneously map the environment and track the camera pose in SO(3). 

This project is a part of the lecture 3D Vision by M. Pollefeys at ETHZ.
